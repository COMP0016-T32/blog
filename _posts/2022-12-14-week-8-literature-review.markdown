We put our research for the literature review together in a presentation. In the presentation, we introduced our project, explored the target users of our project and the benefits that our project can bring to them, our proposed algorithm to implement the project, and the libraries that we intended to use for the project. We recorded our presentation and shared it with our project partners.
