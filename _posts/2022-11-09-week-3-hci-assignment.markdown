We improved our user reqquirements, personas and scenarios using the survey responses and an interview with a NHS staff, which helped us to better understand the potential users of our project. Afterwards, we conducted a heuristic evaluation of our prototype and found several areas of improvement. At the end of this week, we submitted our HCI assignment.
