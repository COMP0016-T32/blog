During the first week, we met our team members and were given our assigned companies' contacts. We were introduced to MotionInput and our overall project which was to create a virtual dance mat and hand jitter stabilization algorithm for use in care homes. Also, we recieved our first (HCI) assignment and began working on personas, scenarios and sketches for our project.
