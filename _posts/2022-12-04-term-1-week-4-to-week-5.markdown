After meeting with our project partners to discuss the details of our project requirements, we began to conduct literature review for our project. We explored the potential games that could be played with our product. We plan to make a pressentation video for literature review.

# Literature Review for Client to Review

To provide our client with insight into our approach to the feet navigation project, we plan to create a literature review video that will be approximately four minutes in length. The video will cover a range of topics, including an overview of relevant technologies and platforms, comparisons of their advantages and disadvantages, and an examination of the latest developments in the field. We will also discuss the impact of our solution on those who will be affected, as well as its competition with other technologies.

Additionally, we will outline the development cycle, including the timeline for prototyping, testing, and code review. We will also provide information on any useful open source libraries and IP that we have identified, as well as team roles and Gantt chart completion. Finally, we will highlight the most impactful aspects of the project and how we will test them.

Our goal is to convey to the client our proposed implementation strategy, the technologies that we will employ, and our team's roles in completing the project.

# How we Divided the Research Topics

As a team, we first determine the scope and key areas of interest for our literature review. Mainly two area, virtual dance mat ( feet gesture detection) and hand jitter correction (compensation algorithms). We then divide the research tasks among ourselves to ensure that all relevant sources are explored thoroughly. Each team member will be responsible for gathering information on specific areas of interest, such as the latest advancements in the field, current technologies and platforms, and notable examples of successful implementations.

Once each team member has completed their research, we will come together to share our findings and discuss our individual perspectives. This will involve identifying key themes and ideas that emerge from our research and discussing the implications of these for our proposed solution. We will also assess the reliability and credibility of the sources we have used, ensuring that our literature review is based on reputable and authoritative sources.

As we work on the literature review, we will also maintain open communication channels to ensure that we remain aligned with the project objectives and requirements. Regular team meetings will allow us to discuss any challenges or questions that arise and make any necessary adjustments to our research approach. By collaborating effectively, we can develop a comprehensive and well-informed literature review that informs our proposed solution and meets the needs of our client.
