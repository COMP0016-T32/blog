During a meeting with Dean, additional tasks were assigned before implementing dance mat and hand jitter. These tasks include creating footpad mode 1 and testing retro games using feet for gameplay. A new football mode for FIFA will also be created, with consideration for players with no hands or arms. Team 26 will assist with implementing MotionInput for FIFA during the holidays.

# Additional Requirements

During our meeting with Dean on Friday, we received additional tasks that need to be completed before implementing the dance mat and hand jitter. Dean expressed that he would like to showcase these new features to Sony or Sonic representatives. The timeline for these tasks should ideally be completed around the week of January 10th-12th.

1. The first task is to create a copy of gamepad mode 3 as footpad mode 1, which should only take 2 days to complete. We will need to ask Chris Zhang to explain each of the gamepad modes, and gamepad mode 3 is the most relevant. The footpad mode will allow for up, down, left, and right movements with the left foot and ABXY movements with the right foot.

2. The second task involves testing 10 retro 2D platformer games in a video, only using feet for gameplay. The third task involves creating a new football mode for FIFA, identifying all the buttons and determining how a person with no hands or arms could control the game. This mode will include running on the spot, making the game character run in FIFA, detecting a kick as a switch, and assigning buttons to kick with the right leg. We may consider mapping the left leg to pass and jump to header or lob the ball.

Lastly, if we have time, we will work on 2D and 3D football games. 

# To Do

1. We will need to contact Chris Zhang to explain pseudo VR and the different gamepad modes. 
2. Collaborate working with Team 26 to assist us during the holidays with implementing MotionInput for FIFA.
