Team32 introduction and project assignment for developing accessibility gestures and Feet Triggers for care homes. Initial touch base with our client and more project background understood.

# Team Introduction

In the first week of our development project, our team members were introduced to each other, and we took the opportunity to discuss our backgrounds and interests to better understand each other's strengths and skills. We were then assigned a project that involved developing "accessibility gestures for in-range mode in social gaming apps and sites suitable for care homes, as well as the development of Feet Triggers designed for aging". At this stage, our primary focus was to understand the scope of the project and identify the key requirements that we needed to fulfill. To achieve this, we scheduled an initial meeting with our client, Professor Dean, and IBM's industrial representative, John McNamara, to discuss the project brief and more details.

# First Client Meeting, Clarifying Requirements with Dean

During the second week, we were formally introduced to our client representative in our first client meeting, and getting insights and suggestions of initial requirements for our project, which involved designing a virtual dance mat and developing a hand jitter stabilisation algorithm suitable for aging care homes. Additionally, we were given our first Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) assignment, we have to create a slide-style report which involved creating personas, scenarios, and sketches for our MotionInput project. This exercise was essential in helping us understand the user requirements and identify the key design elements we needed to incorporate. We recognized that this exercise would be beneficial for future projects as well since it helped us focus on our clients needs and understand what motivated us to deliver an excellent product for MotionInput.
