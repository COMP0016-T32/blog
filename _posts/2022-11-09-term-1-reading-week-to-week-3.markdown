For HCI We improved our user reqquirements, personas and scenarios using the survey responses and an interview with a NHS staff, which helped us to better understand the potential users of our project. Afterwards, we conducted a heuristic evaluation of our prototype and found several areas of improvement. At the same time, we carried our literature review.

# HCI Report

On 7th, we submitted our 10-slide HCI report in power point, our task is to design and evaluate a prototype for your software system. It involves all four stages in the development life cycle: discovering requirements, designing alternatives, prototyping, and evaluation.
We showed our justification of the choice of methods used for each stage and clear consideration of alternatives. Provided strong evidence that pseudo users have been consulted wherever possible or necessary. 

# Initial Literature Review for Our Solution

We started our research about this project including the following sub task:
1.	Read on MotionInput3.2 documentation
2.	Read on windows fluent design
3.	Biological research about various tremor types and similar disabilities.
Level of jitter and categorisation, frequency ect.
Types of posture disorder
4.	Dance Mat (Dongyeon
Existing virtual dance mat
Compensations etc.

Some insight we would consider would be:
1.	Similar Tech/solution on the market
What are their advantages
…
2.	What kind of technology is good, what we need
 
3.	Make a decision for the tech to use
concrete reason for that decision
…
